JMeter Notes
Apache JMeter is a popular open-source load testing tool used to measure the performance of a variety of services, including web applications, web services, and databases. The primary use case of JMeter is to simulate a large number of users accessing a system simultaneously, allowing developers and testers to evaluate the system's performance under heavy loads.

Here are some key benefits of using JMeter in projects:

Load Testing: JMeter helps identify the maximum number of users that a system can handle without compromising its performance. This is crucial in ensuring that the system can scale to meet the demands of a growing user base.
Performance Optimization: By simulating various load scenarios, JMeter helps developers identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the system for better response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
Stress Testing: JMeter can be used to subject a system to extreme loads, helping developers identify the breaking point of the system and making it more resilient to failures.
Functional Testing: JMeter can also be used for functional testing, allowing developers to verify that the system behaves as expected under various load conditions.
